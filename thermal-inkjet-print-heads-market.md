<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Inkjet Print-heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Inkjet</li><li>Random Inkjet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal inkjet printheads operate by heating ink to create vapor bubbles that forcefully expel drops. The market for these printheads can be categorized into two main types: continuous inkjet (CIJ) and random inkjet (also known as drop-on-demand). CIJ systems continuously circulate ink and are ideal for high-speed printing, commonly used in industrial applications. In contrast, random inkjet printheads eject drops as needed, providing more precision and flexibility, making them suitable for lower-volume printing tasks and specialized applications.</p></p>

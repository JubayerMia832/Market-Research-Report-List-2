<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Fixation Type</li><li>Uncemented Fixation Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The unicompartmental knee arthroplasty system market is primarily divided into two types based on fixation methods: cemented fixation and uncemented fixation. Cemented fixation involves the use of bone cement to securely attach the implant to the bone, providing strong stability and immediate load-bearing capacity. In contrast, uncemented fixation utilizes a porous surface that promotes bone ingrowth over time, allowing the implant to bond naturally with the patient's bone. Each type offers distinct advantages, catering to different patient needs and surgical preferences.</p></p>
